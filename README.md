This program is a secure password generator. Note that this program only generates a random password of a specified length but does not save it anywhere.

How to use this program:
Compile and execute the program.
The program will serve you two prompts. 
One asking for your desired password length.
One asking if you want to include special characters in your generated password. 

1. To answer the first prompt, enter an integer number between 1 and 50.

2. To answer the second prompt, type "yes" or "no".

3. The program will generate a randomized password and print it to the console where the user can copy the results to their clipboard.
